### BroChallenge.js 
A coding challenge from my brother, with example of output. 

### To run
The easiest and most hassle-free way to run this is to simply cut and paste the code into your browser console, change the 'Queries' and 'References' object values at the bottom to whatever is desired, and run it. You can also run the file as a script in your terminal with node by saving the file, navigating to the folder it is contained in, and running ```node BroChallenge.js```. Please make sure node you have node installed.
